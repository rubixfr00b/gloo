# Gloo

A lightweight framework for building small-scale dynamic views with JS and HTML.

## Another JS framework? Why?

Modern frameworks are big (35KB? jeez,) rivets.js is not maintained anymore, and I'm bored!

## Goals

- Less than 10KB
- Well-tested code with 100% coverage
- Multiple instances of Gloo can work together even with different versions
- Easy setup
- Intuitive, simple API that allows devs to focus on their own logic without worrying about framework quirks
- No DOM abstraction

## Examples

- [Basic data-binding](docs/basic-examples.md)
